# Tasker Automation Path (TODO)

This directory is a placeholder for the Tasker-based automation approach described in the project documentation.

- For rapid prototyping, use Tasker with MIDI Hub (for RTP-MIDI forwarding) and Tasker plugins to trigger WLED HTTP requests.
- See the main README for the robust Rust/AIDL service implementation.
- Example: Use MIDI Hub to forward USB MIDI to RTP-MIDI, then use a Tasker plugin to trigger HTTP POSTs to WLED's JSON API.

This path is not implemented yet. Contributions welcome!
