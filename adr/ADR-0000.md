# 0000. Architectural Decision Record Template\n\
\n\
## Status\n\
\n\
Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded by [ADR-XXXX](./adr-XXXX.md)\n\
\n\
## Context\n\
\n\
This ADR establishes the process for documenting architectural decisions within the `rtp-midi` project.\n\
It provides a standardized template to ensure consistency, transparency, and traceability of technical choices.\n\
\n\
## Decision\n\
\n\
We will use Markdown files for Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), stored in the top-level `/adr` directory.\n\
Each ADR will follow a strict numbering convention (`ADR-NNNN.md`) and adhere to the template defined in this document.\n\
\n\
All new architectural decisions, significant technical changes, or design choices that have long-term impact on the system\n\
must be documented as an ADR. The process for an ADR is:\n\
\n\
1.  **Propose:** A new ADR is drafted in Markdown, following this template.\n\
2.  **Review:** The ADR is reviewed by relevant team members/stakeholders.\n\
3.  **Accept:** Once consensus is reached, the ADR\'s status is changed to "Accepted" and merged into the `main` branch.\n\
4.  **Implement:** The decision outlined in the ADR is implemented in the codebase.\n\
5.  **Maintain:** If a decision is later revised or superseded, the original ADR\'s status is updated to "Deprecated" or "Superseded",\n\
    with a link to the new ADR.\n\
\n\
## Consequences\n\
\n\
*   **Positive:**\n\
    *   Improved transparency and shared understanding of architectural decisions.\n\
    *   Easier onboarding for new team members.\n\
    *   Clear historical record of "why" certain decisions were made.\n\
    *   Reduced technical debt accumulation by encouraging thoughtful design.\n\
\n\
*   **Negative:**\n\
    *   Initial overhead in documenting decisions.\n\
    *   Requires discipline to maintain and update ADRs.\n\
\n\
## Compliance\n\
\n\
All code changes and new features that involve architectural decisions must reference a corresponding, accepted ADR.\n\
CI/CD pipelines may include checks to ensure ADR compliance for major architectural changes.
