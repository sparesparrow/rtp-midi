# 0000: Use ADRs for Architectural Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the rtp-midi project grows in complexity, it is essential to document architectural decisions in a consistent, discoverable, and reviewable manner. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) provide a lightweight, version-controlled way to capture the context, decision, and consequences of significant technical choices. This ensures that the rationale behind decisions is preserved for current and future contributors.

## Decision

- The project will use the [Architecture Decision Record (ADR)](https://adr.github.io/) process to document all significant architectural and technical decisions.
- All ADRs will be stored in the `/adr` directory at the root of the repository.
- Each ADR will follow this template:

  - **Context:** Background, motivation, and forces at play.
  - **Decision:** The choice made and its justification.
  - **Consequences:** Outcomes, trade-offs, and follow-up actions.

- The approval workflow for ADRs is as follows:
  - New ADRs are proposed via pull request (PR).
  - The PR must be reviewed and approved by the designated tech lead or an appointed reviewer.
  - Once approved, the ADR is merged into the main branch and considered the formal record.

## Consequences

- All major architectural decisions will be transparent, reviewable, and traceable.
- New contributors can quickly understand the rationale behind key decisions.
- The ADR process will help prevent knowledge loss and reduce the risk of repeating past mistakes.
