.mdc File Structure & Best Practices:

File Naming: NNN_name.mdc (NNN = 001-299)
- 001-099: Core/workspace rules
- 100-199: Integration rules
- 200-299: Pattern rules
Higher numbers take precedence if rules conflict

UI Components:
1. Description (top)
   - Brief purpose summary
   - Appears in AI context
2. Globs (top)
   - Comma-separated list
   - Example: /dir1/**/*,/dir2/**/*,/dir3/**/*
   - Use standard glob syntax
3. Body Text (this section)
   - Keep under 25 lines
   - Use concise/shorthand
   - Tag files with @
   - Focus on key directives

Best Practice: The assistant may propose changes to .mdc files for the user to copy into the UI. The assistant should not attempt direct file edits to .mdc files.
